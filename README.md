# Implementation of space colonization algorithms for generating structures appearing in nature

## 2D leaf veins examples
Implementation of a random generation of leaf veins structures (2D) following the [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/epdf/10.1145/1073204.1073251)

## 3D tree branches examples
Generating branches of the tree's crown (3D) through space colonization inspired by [paper](https://diglib.eg.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/7514f4d7-4658-46ff-9141-86213b42c235/content)

The projects uses raylib and zig and the idea of exploring space colonization algorithm through these papers was heavily inspired by watching this [great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu_L8MPvGJM)
